# shlipple
SHitty LIsp in Python Provides Lots of Entertainment.

Shoutout to my peeps McCarthy, Abelson, Sussman, Graham! I mostly relied on the latter's paper on McCarthy ("The Roots of Lisp").

Start a REPL with `python shlipple.py` and code away.

## Currently implemented

In Python:

- atoms (strings, `#t`, `#f`, positive integers)
- lists `(...)`
- `quote`, `'`
- `atom`
- `eq`
- `car`
- `cdr`
- `cons`
- `cond`
- `defun`
- `dec`
- `inc`
- `env` (shows currently active variable and function bindings)
- `lambda`
- `label`

In Shlipple:

- `null`
- `and`
- `not`
- `append`
- `+`
- `-`
- `*`

All very shittily, of course.
